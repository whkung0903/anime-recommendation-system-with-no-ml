A data science project analyzing anime ratings, genres, and user preferences to build a recommendation system.
This project explores data preprocessing, visualization, and collaborative filtering techniques to recommend anime titles based on user behavior.

## **ðŸ“˜ Project Overview**

This notebook performs a full analysis of an anime dataset to uncover patterns and build recommendation models.
It covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the implementation of various recommendation approaches.

## **ðŸ“Š Dataset**

The dataset used is from [Anime Recommendation Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset?select=final_animedataset.csv) (Kaggle)

It contains:

* Anime information: title, genre, episodes, members, and ratings
* User ratings: user ID, anime ID, and rating (1â€“10 scale)

## **ðŸ§  Methodology**

1. Data Cleaning
* Handle missing and inconsistent data
* Normalize text data (titles, genres)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Visualize rating distributions, top genres, and user activity
* Correlation between popularity and average score
3. Result Visualization
* Genre heatmaps, top-N recommendations, and rating patterns

## **ðŸ“ˆ Results Summary**
**I. Audience Insights**

The majority of users are aged 25â€“39, mainly located in Europe and North America. Their rating behaviors are consistent across region, gender, and age, indicating no significant demographic segmentation in anime preferences.

**II. Content Strategy: What to Air**

Since preferences remain stable across different user groups, platforms should focus on content that appeals broadly.

* Top 5 Genres: Award Winning, Suspense, Avant Garde, Drama, Sports
* Top 4 Sources: Manga, Original, Web Manga, Novel

**III. User Engagement Patterns**

While most usersâ€™ viewing days fall below 159 and show no clear correlation with rating behavior, engagement levels do not strongly influence satisfaction.
Popularity and quality only partially overlap (30%), suggesting both should be considered when curating or promoting titles.

**IV. Recommendation System Design**

Given usersâ€™ consistent behavior and high rating stability (low variance within genre/type/source), an item-based recommendation approach is more suitable than a user-based one.

Key predictive features: Genre, Type, and Source.

**V. Strategic Implication**

Platforms should prioritize content diversity within high-performing genres and sources, and refine their recommendation systems around item attributes rather than user demographics or viewing time. This approach maximizes relevance and scalability while aligning with audience preferences.
